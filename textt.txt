🔹 HERO SECTION
BLACKVOLT TECHNOLOGIES
Engineering Autonomous Underwater Systems for Extreme Environments

Blackvolt Technologies is a deep-tech startup focused on the design, development, and validation of autonomous unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) for operation in communication-denied, low-visibility, and high-uncertainty environments.

Our work centers on underwater autonomy, where conventional navigation, sensing, and control methods fail — demanding intelligent decision-making, energy-aware planning, and resilient system design.

We are currently developing a next-generation autonomous UUV platform, supported by in-house research across AI, underwater navigation, perception, and multi-system integration.

🔹 WHY WE DO THIS
Why We Exist

Underwater environments represent one of the most challenging operational domains for autonomous systems.
Severe signal attenuation, unreliable localization, limited sensing, and strict energy constraints make traditional robotic approaches insufficient.

While unmanned underwater platforms are becoming central to global defence and maritime strategy, indigenous development of deeply autonomous UUV systems remains limited.

Blackvolt Technologies was founded to help address this gap.

We believe underwater autonomy must be researched, engineered, tested, and refined within India, through disciplined experimentation and collaboration with universities, research groups, and industry partners.

We approach this challenge with humility, recognizing the complexity of real-world deployment and the importance of rigorous feedback from experienced researchers and practitioners.

Our work is research-driven, engineering-led, and mission-oriented.

🔹 VISION & MISSION
Our Vision

To contribute to India’s long-term maritime and strategic autonomy by developing indigenous unmanned underwater systems capable of intelligent, sustained, and cooperative operation without continuous external support.

Our Mission

To design, prototype, and validate a mission-grade autonomous UUV platform that integrates:

robust underwater perception

intelligent navigation and decision-making

resilient, low-bandwidth communication

energy-aware system design

cooperative multi-agent behavior

All systems are evaluated through measurable performance metrics, controlled testing environments, and repeatable validation pipelines, progressing from simulation to hardware deployment.

🔹 CORE VALUES
Innovation First

Pursuing original approaches to underwater autonomy through modeling, experimentation, and iterative prototyping.

Engineering Rigor

Evaluating every subsystem against real-world underwater constraints, failure modes, and operational limits — not just simulations.

Indigenous Capability

Developing core autonomy, control, and system architecture in-house to reduce reliance on externally controlled technologies.

National Responsibility

Building systems intended to strengthen maritime security, resilience, and long-term technological independence.

🔹 THE UUV PLATFORM (PRIMARY PRODUCT)
Autonomous Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV)

Our primary product is a modular autonomous UUV platform, designed as a foundation for long-term research, field validation, and eventual operational deployment.

Key Design Objectives

Operate without continuous GPS or surface communication

Navigate reliably in low-visibility and cluttered underwater environments

Maximize endurance under strict energy constraints

Enable autonomous mission execution with minimal human intervention

Core Capabilities

Autonomous underwater navigation

Onboard perception and sensor fusion

Intelligent mission planning and execution

Fault-aware control and recovery logic

Expandable payload and sensor architecture

This platform serves as the basis for Project ANTARLEEN.

🔹 PROJECT ANTARLEEN (FLAGSHIP PROGRAM)
Project ANTARLEEN

Project ANTARLEEN is Blackvolt’s flagship development effort focused on building a high-autonomy, long-endurance unmanned underwater vehicle.

The project targets fundamental challenges in underwater robotics, including:

navigation without continuous localization

acoustic communication limitations

energy-aware planning and control

cooperative operation between multiple underwater units

ANTARLEEN is designed as a scalable platform, not a one-off prototype — enabling iterative improvements in autonomy, sensing, and coordination.
